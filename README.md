JavaScript Foundations Skills - Beginner

### Project 
This is the seventh and last segment of the project. Code is updated from branch [project_6](https://github.com/apa017/javascript-foundations-beginner/tree/project_6). 

This project goes back to the concept of loop, explored in previous assets:
- [project_5/main.js](https://github.com/apa017/javascript-foundations-beginner/blob/project_5/main.js) - where for loop was used to iterate an array
- [project_6/main.js](https://github.com/apa017/javascript-foundations-beginner/blob/project_6/main.js) - where while loop was used to iterate code until a condition is met

In this branch the following actions were taken:
- abc
- def
