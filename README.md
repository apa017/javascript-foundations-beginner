JavaScript Foundations Skills - Beginner

### Project 4
This is the fourth segment of the project. Code is updated from branch [project_3](https://github.com/apa017/javascript-foundations-beginner/tree/project_3). 

In this branch the following actions were taken:

- Store an input in `main.js`
- Edit `index.html` using tags with id to pinpoint variables from js file
- Get element from `main.js` to `index.html` rather than console (i.e. print output visible to user)
- Concatenate the inputs
- Edit `styles.css` to improve visibility of new tag
