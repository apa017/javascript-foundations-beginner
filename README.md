JavaScript Foundations Skills - Beginner

### Project 5
This is the fifth segment of the project. Code is updated from branch [project_4](https://github.com/apa017/javascript-foundations-beginner/tree/project_4). 

In this branch the following actions were taken:

- Create arrays on `main.js`
- Test several outputs from the array in console: whole array, single item by index, every item in a loop
- Adding new values to array
- Modify existing values of an array

All work has been done solely on `main.js`
