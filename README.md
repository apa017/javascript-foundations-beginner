JavaScript Foundations Skills - Beginner

### Project 6
This is the sisxth segment of the project. Code is updated from branch [project_5](https://github.com/apa017/javascript-foundations-beginner/tree/project_5). 

In this branch the following actions were taken:

- Ensure the user inputs a value between 1 and 100. This is achieved by parsing value to integer and providing a while loop condition
- Return a message on the console based on user output
- On `index.html` return the output message on a pop up window

All changes were done solely on `main.js`
