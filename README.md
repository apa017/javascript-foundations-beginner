JavaScript Foundations Skills - Beginner

### Project 7
This is the seventh and last segment of the project. Code is updated from branch [project_6](https://github.com/apa017/javascript-foundations-beginner/tree/project_6). 

This project goes back to the concept of loop, explored in previous assets:
- [project_5/main.js](https://github.com/apa017/javascript-foundations-beginner/blob/project_5/main.js) - where for loop was used to iterate an array
- [project_6/main.js](https://github.com/apa017/javascript-foundations-beginner/blob/project_6/main.js) - where while loop was used to iterate code until a condition is met

In this branch the following actions were taken:
- create a template for for-loop
- create a loop with user prompt
- provide output in browser console for `index.html`
- provide output as popup alert and as text in `index.html`
