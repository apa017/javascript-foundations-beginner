JavaScript Foundations Skills - Beginner

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate how to use JavaScript in web applications. <br>
All testing is done on a local server.

For this projects, three assets were created:
- `index.html`: is the web application and front-end
- `main.js`: is the JavaScript back-end
- `styles.css`: it is the styling of `index.html`

#### Requirements
- VisualStudio is the recommended IDE for the assets in this repository
- Additionally, <b>LiveServer</b> and <b>Material Icon Theme</b> integrations were installed.

#### Table of Contents

The repository is articulated in branches. Each branch is a separate project that reworks the code to demonstrate different functionalities. 

###### [project_1](https://github.com/apa017/javascript-foundations-beginner/tree/project_1)
Creates the structure of the web application and links `main.js` to `index.html`. Provides 'hello world' application with browser console logs.

###### [project_2](https://github.com/apa017/javascript-foundations-beginner/tree/project_2)
Works on `main.js` with prompt variables from user to browser console log. Demonstrates string-2-integer conversion and mathematical operations.

###### [project_3](https://github.com/apa017/javascript-foundations-beginner/tree/project_3)
Works on `styles.css`, providing styles for H1 and body of `index.html`.

###### [project_4](https://github.com/apa017/javascript-foundations-beginner/tree/project_4)
Works on `main.js` and `index.html` so that user inputs are displayed in the web app rather than browser console. `styles.css` is improved.

###### [project_5](https://github.com/apa017/javascript-foundations-beginner/tree/project_5)
Works on `main.js` to create and modify arrays. Outputs are demonstrated in web console.

###### [project_6](https://github.com/apa017/javascript-foundations-beginner/tree/project_6)
Works on `main.js` with IF/ELSE conditions to restrict user inputs (while loop) and provide different outputs as pop-up alert message on `index.html`.

###### [project_7](https://github.com/apa017/javascript-foundations-beginner/tree/project_7)
Works on `main.js` with for loops and arrays to provide more complex outputs on browser console and `index.html` in different formats.
